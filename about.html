			<p id="txtCC2">I grew up in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.
My career in advertising brought me to study in my
early twenties. After working for several large ad
agencies in the city, I left the rat race to be home
with my three spirited (read: loud and strong-willed)
children. Being a full-time mom is the best job in the
world. It’s also the hardest and not always the most
fulfilling.Then a magical thing happened: I discovered
my love for writing.And over the course of a couple of
life-changing years,I wrote my first novel, Only Child.
I can’t believe I get to share it with you now! Only It
will also be published in many countries around the world
and translated into sixteen other languages. I can’t wait
for you to read it. I made this website for you, dear reader.
I invite you to become involved. Would you like to invite me
to talk about Only Child at your next book club or library
event? I'm available for events in the NYC area or via Skype
or FaceTime. Contact me here. Please check out my upcoming
events, I would love to see you there.</p>
